# Capstone: Customer Segmentation for E commerce Personalization

## Note: This is the final project to complete the Unsupervised Learning Foundation Course.

### Project Overview

This project uses K-means clustering and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior within an e-commerce dataset. The aim is to discover distinct groups of customers with similar preferences and behaviors to enable personalized marketing strategies and recommendations.

### Dataset Information

-The dataset to be used is the Online Retail Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

-Dataset can be accessed at: Online Retail Dataset

### Steps

### Data Preparation:

Begin with downloading the Online Retail Dataset. The data needs to be preprocessed which includes handling missing values, cleaning the data, and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis.

### Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from the dataset that reflect customer behavior, such as purchase history, order frequency, and total spending. Additional metrics like the recency of purchase or average basket size might also be calculated to capture customer behavior more accurately.

### Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:

Apply PCA to decrease the dimensionality of the feature space, aiming to retain the most informative features. This step is designed to highlight underlying patterns and structures in the data.

### Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters:

Employ methods like the elbow method or silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering. Experimentation with different values of K is necessary to evaluate the clustering outcome and select the best option.

### K-means Clustering:

With the dimensionality reduced, perform K-means clustering to assign each customer to a cluster based on their feature values. Analyze the clusters to interpret the characteristics of each customer segment.

### Cluster Profiling:

Profile each cluster by calculating specific metrics such as average spending, purchase frequency, or popular product categories. This profiling helps in identifying the distinguishing features and behaviors of each cluster.

### Visualization:

Use visualization techniques like scatter plots to depict the clusters and their separation. This will aid in visualizing how customers are grouped in the reduced feature space and the distinctions between clusters.

### Evaluation:

Assess the clustering quality using appropriate metrics such as the silhouette score or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). This evaluation helps in understanding the cohesiveness and separation of the clusters, indicating the effectiveness of the segmentation.

### Personalization and Recommendations:

Based on the identified customer segments, devise personalized marketing strategies and recommendations. Tailor promotions, product suggestions, and communication methods for each cluster to boost customer engagement and satisfaction.

### Interpretation and Insights:

Interpret the outcomes of the segmentation and provide insights. Discuss the implications for the e-commerce business, including targeted marketing, customer retention strategies, or inventory management.
